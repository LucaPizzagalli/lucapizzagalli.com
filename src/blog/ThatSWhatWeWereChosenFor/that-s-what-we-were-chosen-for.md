# That's what we were chosen for
** better story about how freedom solves happiness problem, as helmet / marriage are limitations on the freedom of future people, and future people are different people, so 
no safety belt means death that means not existence, that means absolutely limit the personal freedom of a future person. But with superpowers you can even change the past. not literally, but if you decide you did something wrong you can change the entire universe same as if you took a different decision in the past **

*Guy with a funny hat*: "newmann probes something something"

*Girl with a fancy dress*: "That's the easy part. That's not why we are here. What's next."

*Gwfh*: "Everyone will be free, everyone will be empowered. In the current society we have
formal freedom. But that's not actual freedom. Because of the slowdown there are still goals that cannot be achieved.
What's the point of having legal freedom if you don't have the means to achieve your goals?
With so much power and resources there will be a golden epoch of almost infinite abundance. Everyone bla bla.
We can maximize personal freedom. We'll still have to pay attention to competition and zero sum games, bla bla -"

*Gwfd*: "you know, safety belt. When wheeled vehicles, death was not reversible"

*Dude with a long beard*: "And the organ market..."

*Dwlb*: "And gambling..."

*Dwlb*: "And hard drugs..."

*Dwlb*: "And marriage..."

*Dwlb*: "An-"

*Gwfd*: "Barbaric law prohibiting suicide. Now basic pillar of every civilized society. I'm not of course arguing we should reinstantiate that,
but what I'm saying is that the people have spoken. Personal freedom is not viewed as an absolute right, and in an accident of history we went as far
as negating one of the, if not **the**, fundamental pillar of personal freedom, in any civilized society."
*Gwfh*: "I see your point. We have to strike a balance between freedom and happiness. bla bla let;s"

*Gwfd*: "Pirimpippolo, we already did that experiment. You now how it ended. The people have spoken."

*Gwfh*: "That's not the same! That's different!"

*Gwfh recomposes himself, and lowers his tone of voice.*

*Gwfh*: "That's not what I meant. You know that."

"what's the difference"

*Gwfh*: "The "lost ones" cannot move, they cannot think, even. Their corpses went through necrosis, they cannot do anything.
They are just stuck in the cave system, they have no freedom at all."

*Gwfd*: "You have wrong information, Pirimpippolo. Their body and not-pleasure-centers of their brain are also kept alive by the system.
Necrosis by un-utilization is artificially inhibited exactly for the reason of keeping their ability of choice.
If they don't move a finger is not because they can't, it's because they don't want to."
it was a long ago, but the scars are still open, people are still scared, they prefer to not talk about it, to not think about it.
story about a group of people persuing hedonism, the enanchement of brains, the increasing of resource and energy consumptions
brains as big as cites, metal scaffolding, optic fibers for latency reduction, toll on the whole economic system,
hard polytical decision to stop satisfiing their desire, realization that there can still be scarcity in society, hope that they
will one day decide to see they loved ones once again. but no need for that
they are still connected to the Network, their brain activity is almost flat, but there is still one thought, there is still a
request send incessantly into the network, a request made by every single brain: more. More energy more resources, more pleasure intensity.
A request that we ignore every single second. This happened in a time we can now consider another era, so much so that today the energy demand of the cave system
is only a small dent in the total energy production. But even at the time, death was already a choice since a long time.
There was quite a clear split between people wanting an end and people wanting to live. The former ceased to be quite soon.
By the time of the brain separation, we were not used to the concept of death anymore. The suffering of loosing a close one was something anew.
In a world almost free of pain, the loss en mass of ... hit us unexpectedly, it hit us hard.
We kept the bodies alive This kept alive our hope, with the result of not being able to find peace. With the result of prolonging the suffering.

*Gwfh*: "..."

An obvious way out existed, and some voices even raised the possibility. People were disgusted.
A word of pure hedonic pleasure meant, yes, happiness, but with no meaning.
Fear was re-discovered, and the ban was instituted. The people have spoken.

*An electric signal ran through the secondary spinal cord of Dwlg, from his brain directly to the chair motor control chip.
The chair stared moving towards the end of the table, just instants before the original signal caused a cascade process in
Dwlg's brain, making him aware of his will to move.*

*Gwfh*: "Then... what."

*Gwfd*: "Humans have always been explorers. They find meaning in the discovery of new lands, in the struggle necessary for reaching nuove mete.
They started exploring the lands, then the sees, than the space. Achieving greater knowledge. Improving the human condition, for ourself and for others. Felling of progress."

*Gwfh*: "And I guess you're not talking about the newmann-probes-conquering-universe kind of exploration."

*Gwfd*: "Physics is a solved problem. After the unified model was discovered physicist moved to collective systems
Sure, we can continue refining the three constants to absolute useless precision levels, and we'll do.
The craziness of the experiments trying to disprove the unified model grows in absurdity by the year.
Truth is, no one has a spark of doubt left anymore.
The final frontieer, the only frontier is math. We haven't find boundaries yet, we aren't even close to it.
Quite the opposite I would say. The more we explore, the more we find out about the existence of new lands, lands that before we weren't even able to imagine.
maybe math problems are infinite, and profs are interesting, and ways to discover proofs are interesting, and the metaways...
Or maybe not, but at least we can hope
If so it can keep exploring forever, expanding its understanding, using its newly discovered understanding to keep improving more.
Not a simple storage system. A "book" were the theorems are written. you need an elaboration processing, where the knolege is "active",
where the system is using that information, it's processing the information, it's an information processing machine, as it is the very nature of the universe.
Instead or random computation with decoherence the coherence is used its fullest and negentropy is not simply wasted as heat.
Who knows, maybe a sense of curiosity and wonder will also emerge from the immensely complicated circuitry."

*Gwfh*: is this one person or multiple persons?

*Gwfd*: probably multiple persons. but the border is fuzzy. the density of the computer has to be kept low enough so that the thing doesn't collapse into a black hole.
this, toghether with the limitatness of the speed of light, means that there will be latency. Information will take large times to travel between subsystem located in different
part of the thing. Large compared to the time necessary to the subsystems to perform significant ammounts of computation. this means we could somehow consider them as different entities.

Keeping a sense of personal identity is the reason why the communication between us is throttled.
It's the reason we kept alive the usage of language altogether. That, and some kind of romantic attachment to our origins.
If the connection between Jules and his chair would be bidirectional they would be legally considered a single actor.
If not only the signal could travel from Jules to the chair, but also vice-versa; if Jules were found committing a crime,
the chair would have to be condanntata, together with him. Can you imagine that?

*You could have seen a smile on Dwlb's face, if not for the beard covering it.*

*Gwfh*: Here me out. I'll sound naive, I'll sound as a fool. But this ought to be said. but ad ogni modo the blubbu procedure also chose me.
We have choice, we can do wathever we want, we don't have to create a computer monster that kills literally everyone. Is this what the people want?
Semms to me they are not that willing to give up their lives that ligthly, after all.
Why don't we create a paradise? people live in harmony with nature, spend time togheter, play games, have sex, love each other.
that's the way things used to be, and it was cool.
ok at some point we'll have to reset

*Gwfd*: "Our audience is too sophysticated to buy into that.
'Nature' is a series of random accidents plus survivorship bias. Different accidents would have produced different 'natures'.
You can imagine a multitude of 'natures' some of them better than 'our' nature, foar wichever definition of better you prefer.
Picking the one we know is an ungiustified arbitrary choice. Same can be said of the human form. People care about this stuff.
What you are describing is just a complicated jigsaw machine. Watch it in the scale of billions of years. Society develops, people struggle fight enjoy, are happy, progress. They reach the top.
and they are re-setted and the cycle repeat. maybe it repeats differently, you can create as many varyation as you want, but still, every time pointless.
and then it repeats again, and again. a pointless loop"

*Gwfh*: "but not pointless for them! we can even do that the system determines a set of conditions and fixed challenges.
It will be up to them to meet the things. their condition will be in their hands, ther choices will have consequences, their actions will matter. you yourself said there is no absolute meaning. Then only subjective meaning can be achieved, and they will have meaning.
We could even be in the loop, and so far we managed pretty well with the meaning crysis, this could be a good time to reset."

*Gwfd*: even the lost ones have a will and a goal, they still send "more" to the network

*Gwfd*: "Yes, we could create a word with meaning, but that's not what we were chosen for."

*Gwfh*: "That's literally what we were chosen for."

----

*Gwfd*: "TODO: future doesn't matter. people in the feauture are not people now. they are different. what they care is their well being, not other well being"

*Gwfh*: "well seems to me they care about having food this eveningc"

*Gwfh*: "they care because the feel connected with the future version of themselves, as they feel connected to their friends, the idea of this other beings struggling
    makes them unsatisfied now. future counts only as inderect reflection of the impact it has on them now.
    themsevels tomorrow: super connected. A firend now: very connected, a human of a different culture in the far past: very little connected.
    But well being of entities is not the only think they care. For example, elegance has its importance.
    The image of the end of the civilization as a perfect computer carry more elegance that the end as a pointless loop machine full of arbitrary implementation.
    If we eould propose to substitue them tomorrow, for make space to a computer they'll fight against it, because they are about of the them of tomorrow.
    But as we push that tomorrow further and furhter in the future the people care less and less about the future version of themselves and their fellows.
    We are planning for the end of the times here, remember. We can just pick a threshold far enough and everyone will care about the elegance more than the future beings.
    There future version will not want that, as it's close to them, and the people of now know that. But the tomorrow people are fare enough that that doesn't matter for the today people"

*Gwfh*: "people are fucked up"

*Gwfd*: "people are made of bla bla, but for making one you need just four components.
    an instinctive sense of meaning given by evolution, as there is no goal in the universe.
    Contraddiction in the belief system, as otherwise everything would be symple.
    Foolishness. As an incoherent system collapses into itself, you can prove that everything is good and bad at the same time.
    People are smart enough that if they sit on a chair and think of the big picture they can grasp the meaningless of it.
    But the moment they stand up and go on with their life they forget about it, they lose sight of the incoerences, and in the small scale of the everyfay life they find meaning.
    Weakness, as even the foolishnes of humans has limits. As we grow more and more powerful the small everyday problem are fixed, and we focus on bigger ones,"

*Gwfd*: "And the people,

not even my privilege goes that far


*Gwfh*: "So the decision is taken. Why was I even chosen."

Well, why was Jules chosen.

*beard movements*

*they go to the door*


but then, what we are watching is the jigsaw machine, the people are inside it. They have meaning. And this pod, only this pod is the outside of the machine.
Then... what is our goal, what is **your** goal?

"You volounteer for this Pirimpippolo, I did not. When I was chosen by the procedure I asked to be paid for this.
Between the people there are some quite wealthy individual. I was paid **a lot**."

"Oh, c'mon Prapamprappala! you're fucking with me. Money for the sake of money?
is the the goal at the end of all? Isn't the mining business making enough money for you?"

"No, money for the sake of the japanese reactor"

*Jules chunckle*

"But... why..."

*description of the exit*

I bent the rules, Pirimpippolo. I talked with the bureaucrats, I've been allocated a slot. In the sdfsasfa cave system.






when someone proved physics *is* math even the last doubters admitted that a simulated consciusness is as real as one implemented directly on top of the physical substrate.
and the people agreed on the ban.

the implication of not being able to change what's happening in the outer layer of the expantion bubble caused the slowdown.
this is the pivotal moment for deciding the goal to code into the probes, before they are launched.
