                    Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a green algae, a single cell eukaryotic organism, 10 miicro meters in size, that lives in soil and fresh water. It is a model organism in biology, used for studying photosynthesis and ciliary functions in eukaryotes. Recently,
                    Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has drawn attention as a possible source of useful proteins and bio-fuels.

                    The propulsion mechanism of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is provided by two anterior flagella that move in a breast-stroke movement, as shown in the video, at a frequency of 50 Hz. if we observe the motion for a longer time it can be seen that the periods
                    of swimmings are interrupted by shorter periods in which the cell reorient itself. this is due to an asyncrony between the two flagella and this motion is called run and tumble motion.

                    The goal of my work is to define a mathematical model able to reproduce the swimming of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, capturing the statistical properties of the diffusion in space of the cell and of the interactions with physical surfaces. Some possible
                    applications of this organism include its use confined in a quasi-2D environment, like micro-channels or surfaces. For this reason, and for availability of experimental data, the model developed is in two dimensions.

                    The shape of the micro-swimmer has a great influence on the way it interacts with walls, particularly the trapping time duration. For a good characterization of the interaction between the cell and a wall a simple spherical model is not sufficient; when
                    near a barrier, the forward flagella interacts with the surface, and the resulting torque causes the rotation of the cell. I use an asymmetric dumbbell as a model for the cell that consists of two spheres with radii a b and a f, connected
                    by a rigid rod of length l. The green sphere represents the body of the cell, while the blue sphere represents the area covered by the beating flagella. e is the vector of norm 1 facing the swimming's direction of the cell. This kind
                    of dumbbell model is frequently used for modelling micro-swimmers.

                    The model illustrated is quite simple, however it already depends on quite a few parameters, for the shape, propulsion, random perturbations and tumble. After a literature search I found these values for the parameters. However, for the propulsive speed
                    v 0, there are different values in the literature that correspond to different strands of C. reinhardtii, different measurement conditions and techniques. They are in a range from 60 to 110 micro meter per second. Regarding noise intensities
                    mu and tau, no experimental values could be found in the literature. To obtain these parameters I considered different experiments, and fitted the parameters to best reproduce the empirical data.

                    The first experiment consider the cell in an environment without obstacles, where it's free to move. This plot shows the experimental measure of the mean square displacement for a cell in a quasi 2D chamber of height 25 micro meters. From the figure we
                    can see that the motion is ballistics for the first instants, with the mean square displacement proportional to t squared, and diffusive for longer times, with the mean square displacement proportional to the time.

                    Another study reports empirical data about the statistical properties of a single cell swimming confined in an almost-2D disk. All experiments were performed in circular compartments with radii ranging from 25 micro meters to 500 micro meters; the height
                    of the compartments was approximately 20 micro meters. The probability density here defined, represents how much time the cell spends at different distances from the center. The figure shows that for all the experiment most of the
                    time is spent near the wall.

                    I then discretized the equations of motion and implemented a numerical simulation for the presented model, written in the language C++. Here on the left there is a recording of the real Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, on the right a rendering of my simulation.
                    We can see that the model mimics the real cell, the dumbbell spends lots of time near the wall, but it also travels trough the center area.

                    Let us consider now the influence of the tumble on the statistical properties of the micro-swimmer's movement. Different simulations have been performed for different values of $T_t$, the torque representing the tumble. From the figure \ref{fig:open_tumble_displacement}
                    we can see that the tumble starts having an influence on the mean-square-displacement only after about one second from the start; this is caused by the fact that in the simulation the microswimmer starts in a non-tumbling configuration,
                    and only after a random time the first tumble begins. A stronger torque means a more drastic reorientation of the cell and this is reflected in a minor mean-square displacement. The tumble has also an effect on the radial probability.
                    The persistence time near the wall decreases with the increasing strength of the tumble as a stronger tumble means higher probability of reorienting the cell away from the wall. Analogous effects on both mean-square-displacement and
                    radial probability can be expected to induce a variation in the tumble duration or in the frequency of tumbling events.

                    The next parameter to be varied is $\mu$. The value of $\mu$ influences the intensity of the random noise, that perturbs the cell's swimming. This can be seen in the mean-square-displacement (Figure \ref{fig:open_diffusivity_displacement}); $\mu$ has
                    an influence in the first moments of swimming (mostly the first second). After some time the displacement caused by the propulsive speed of the cell becomes predominant and the different plots converge. Figure \ref{fig:confined_diffusivity_radial_probability}
                    shows the radial probability; as the intensity of the noise increases the movement of the cell is more disturbed and the time spent near the wall decreases.

                    The last parameter dependency to be evaluated is the one on $\tau_p$. $\tau_p$ determines the strength of the rotational noise. As expected there is an inverse correlation between the mean-square-displacement and $\tau_p$ (figure \ref{fig:open_noise_rotation_displacement}).
                    Unlike the case with $\mu$, however, this is relevant in the longer term, because $\tau_p$ affects the rotation of the cell and so the direction of the propulsive speed. Also, contrary to $\mu$, $\tau_p$ has a negative effect on the
                    mean-square-displacement, as increasing the rotational diffusion reduces the linearity of the trajectory, and so the msd. From figure \ref{fig:confined_noise_rotation_radial_probability} we can see that a stronger rotational noise
                    implies a shorter retention times near the wall, this time in analogy with the case of $\mu$.

                    Experimental measurements of Chlamydomonas' macroscopic diffusion are available from the work \cite{polin2009chlamydomonas}. A suspension of $1.5 ml$ of Chlamydomonas is transferred in a test tube of size $ 20 \times 12.2 \times 4 mm $ and centrifuged
                    at 350 g for 2.5 min, causing the sedimentation of the suspended cells. Figure \ref{fig:diffusion_polin2009chlamydomonas} reports the measurements of the cells' linear density distribution across the test tube after one minute form
                    the end of the centrifugation process. I simulated one minute of $10000$ Chlamydomonas' cells diffusing from a concentrated initial state, with a time-step of $10^{-3} s$. Picture \ref{fig:diffusion_my} reports the linear concentration
                    at different times of the micro-swimmers' suspension according to the simulation. The final distribution is qualitatively similar to the experimental measurement. However, the max value of the simulated distribution is not at the absolute
                    bottom of the test tube only because of the starting condition. Instead, for the experiment, the reason explaining why the max density is not exactly located at the bottom is to be found in the physical traits of C. reinhardtii.

                    In this work I developed a mathematical model of C. reinhardtii. The model formalizes the eukaryotes' motion taking into account the propulsion coming from the flagella activity, the perturbation due to the thermal noise, the tumbling activity, and the
                    interaction between the cell and a surface. The comparison between the numerical simulations and empirical data shows that the developed model is able to qualitatively reproduce some fundamental properties of the motion of the cell
                    and its interaction with obstacles: - Looking at the mean-square-displacement as function of time, the model is able to reproduce both the ballistic behaviour typical of the first instants of motion and the subsequent transition to
                    a diffusive motion when the direction the cell is facing has been randomized by the rotational noise and the tumble events. - The compatibility as been observed also with experiments of a single cell in a confined environment. The
                    plot of the radial probability resulting from the numerical simulations (fig. \ref{fig:radius_radial_probability}) well captures the facts that most of the time is spent by the cell near the surface. - Finally, the plot \ref{fig:diffusion_my}
                    of the time evolution of the simulation of a multitude of active particles in the same environment shows that it is also possible to capture some the collective quality of the Chlamydomonas' motion. I then proceeded testing the robustness
                    of the model by changing the value of its parameters. A significant dependence of the result on all the parameters is observed. For this reason, and having in mind the variability and uncertainty of some parameters of the model, we
                    can expect that quantitative predictions based on this model can show some discrepancies with empirical data. The last comparison between the diffusion of thousands simulated active-particles and the diffusion of the real cells of
                    C. reinhardtii in a suspensions shows a first limitation in the description power of the model. The real Chlamydomonas exhibits gravitaxis while for the mathematical model here developed the space is isotropic. This introduces the
                    opportunity for future developments and improvements. The model here developed does not exactly describe all the aspects of the behaviour of C. reinhardtii. However an extension of such model could capture the way C. reinhardtii perceives
                    the environment and adapts to the different conditions, particularly reproducing gravitaxis, chemotaxis and phototaxis.

                    In this work I developed a mathematical model of C. reinhardtii. The model formalizes the eukaryotes' motion taking into account the propulsion coming from the flagella activity, the perturbation due to the thermal noise, the tumbling activity, and the
                    interaction between the cell and a surface. The comparison between the numerical simulations and empirical data shows that the developed model is able to qualitatively reproduce some fundamental properties of the motion of the cell
                    and its interaction with obstacles: - Looking at the mean-square-displacement as function of time, the model is able to reproduce both the ballistic behaviour typical of the first instants of motion and the subsequent transition to
                    a diffusive motion when the direction the cell is facing has been randomized by the rotational noise and the tumble events. - The compatibility as been observed also with experiments of a single cell in a confined environment. The
                    plot of the radial probability resulting from the numerical simulations (fig. \ref{fig:radius_radial_probability}) well captures the facts that most of the time is spent by the cell near the surface. - Finally, the plot \ref{fig:diffusion_my}
                    of the time evolution of the simulation of a multitude of active particles in the same environment shows that it is also possible to capture some the collective quality of the Chlamydomonas' motion. I then proceeded testing the robustness
                    of the model by changing the value of its parameters. A significant dependence of the result on all the parameters is observed. For this reason, and having in mind the variability and uncertainty of some parameters of the model, we
                    can expect that quantitative predictions based on this model can show some discrepancies with empirical data. The last comparison between the diffusion of thousands simulated active-particles and the diffusion of the real cells of
                    C. reinhardtii in a suspensions shows a first limitation in the description power of the model. The real Chlamydomonas exhibits gravitaxis while for the mathematical model here developed the space is isotropic. This introduces the
                    opportunity for future developments and improvements. The model here developed does not exactly describe all the aspects of the behaviour of C. reinhardtii. However an extension of such model could capture the way C. reinhardtii perceives
                    the environment and adapts to the different conditions, particularly reproducing gravitaxis, chemotaxis and phototaxis.
